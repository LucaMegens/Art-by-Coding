# Art_by_Coding

Art_by_Coding is my Passion Project. On this website I take you on a journey about the meaning of life and death.


## Story

‘’Let’s go on a journey about life and death and what it means to live.

We all get born and we all die. That’s what everything in this universe has in common, there is no way to escape death. Those who try never lived anyway. 
There is no point in waiting, if you want to live you have to live everyday like it’s your last and have no regrets on things you did or did not do. 

If you can live your life to the fullest like this you might be able to do extraordinary things and live for hundreds of years, or you die within your first months of life, I can’t tell that fate to you, what I can tell you is that you can’t make any difference in where you start, but you can make a difference in where you end. It is the journey that counts, not the destination, together with this you can extend your legacy by thousands of years, or not be remembered by anyone. The choice is yours.

A piece of advice from me is to live like everyday is your last day, it could end in an instant, so make sure you don’t have any regrets.’’


## Requirements
The only thing you need to run this WebApp is Visual studio code with the live server plugin, or any other text editor and a localhost.


## Further development/Libraries

In this project I use a bunch of libraries. The libraries I used are [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) and [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com/)

The idea was that users could explore this story about life and death however they wanted it to via abstract (interactive) motion graphics and kinetic typography , but to get to the next page the users have to search for hidden buttons.
The main theme is white and black, yin and yang, life and death. But the further you go into a direction of the story the further you can explore the universe and nature.
For example, a user could stumble upon a hidden jungle with vast varieties of different species. These jungles and landscapes are not limited to earthly landscapes either.
When the users are going through the story they will start to think about life and death more and more, while simultaneously learning about their own existence.


## Used Code

Step2.html uses PixiJS to animate and create the particles. I did not write this piece of code using PixiJS, I only modified some parameters so that the kinetic typography gets the look that I want.

The original writer of this piece of code is Mooyeon-Choi.
